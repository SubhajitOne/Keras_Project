# Keras_Project

This Project is about predicting whether a person will be eligible to get loan or not.
There are certain 27 features which help us in predicting the eligibility.
Here 'loan_status' is the predicting feature.
At first certain Explainatory Data Analysis are done to see how these features are correlated to the actual predicting feature.
Secondly Data Preprocessing is done where missing values are dealt with.
Then converting Categorical variables into Dummy variables.
In the end using Keras Aa neural network is formed to run the model and to predict whether a person will be eligible to get loan.
A new data was introduced and prediction was done on this data.
