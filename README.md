# Keras_Project

This Project is about predicting whether a person will be eligible to get loan or not.
There are 27 features which help us in predicting the eligibility.
Here 'loan_status' is the predicting feature.
At first certain Explainatory Data Analysis were done to see how these features are correlated to the actual predicting feature.
Secondly Data Preprocessing was done where missing values are dealt with.
Then Categorical variables were  converted into Dummy variables.
At the end using Keras, neural network was formed to run the model and to predict whether a person will be eligible to get loan.
A new data was introduced and prediction was done on this data.
